## Resource structure

- id*: `number - required`
	- Unique number: an id should not be repeated in the same json file.
	- It is recommended to add the new resources at the end and follow the order with the previous id.
- order*: `number - required`
	-  Number between 0 and 100 that represents the quality of the resource. Being 0 bad and 100 excellent.
	-	 To rate the quality of a resource, you can use criteria like: UI/UX design, how permissive the license is (CC0 is great, needing to attribute or not use in commercial projects not so much), is it completely free or just some elements, etc.
- name*: `string - required`- Name of the resource.
- link*: `string - required` - Link to the resource.
- img*: `string - required` - Image URL
	- It must follow the following format: https://res.cloudinary.com/cosmocloudinary/image/upload/freesets/category/name_id, where category is the category of the image (icons, tools, 3d...) and name_id It is a unique name that should not be repeated. An example can be: https://res.cloudinary.com/cosmocloudinary/image/upload/freesets/photos/rjsgqt0ldn8betpkcmty.
	- You don't need to upload any photos, just complete the url.
- license: `string`
	- License of the resource.
	- If you need to add a description to the license and the resource does not have a clear license, you can use words like "Free", "Freemium" or "Free with attribution".
- licenseLink: `string` - Link to the resource license.
- licenseDescription: `string` - Description and important information of the license.
- tags: `array of strings` - Tags, for example: `IA`, `React`, `Library`, `Loaders`...
